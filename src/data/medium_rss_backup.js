      "description": "\n<p>When it comes to front-end frameworks, I talk about React a lot. <em>Who doesn’t love React?!</em> It’s my preferred framework for a number of reasons; it’s intuitive, powerful, and flexible. In fact, React is so much my go-to framework that a friend of mine jokingly called me out on it, asking if I could even name another framework.</p>\n<p><strong>I could.</strong> I got the hint though. Acknowledging to myself that I hadn’t used some of the other popular frameworks very much, if at all…</p>\n<p>So, I decided it was time to try Angular. Here’s how it went.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dY-4TRwurt8dVasO.jpg\"><figcaption>Do you even Angular, bro?</figcaption></figure><h3>Angular in a Nutshell</h3>\n<p>Before I dive into my analysis, let’s just touch on what Angular is and how it differs from React. For starters, Angular is an open-sourced TypeScript-based framework (whereas React is a Javascript library). Angular is maintained by Google, along with the open source community (React is maintained by Facebook). Another very important thing to note is that <strong><em>Angular and AngularJS are different things</em></strong>. AngularJS (or Angular v1) is a Javascript library just like React. Angular2+ is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, re-designed as a full fledged framework.</p>\n<h4>Framework vs Library</h4>\n<p>So what does it mean that Angular is a <em>Framework</em>, but React is a <em>Library</em>? Well, when using a library, you have more control over the flow of the application. <strong>You</strong> are choosing when and where to call the library’s components and functions. When you use a framework, <strong>the framework</strong> is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but only calls on your code as needed.</p>\n<p>Here’s a great analogy I recently came across: <strong>Libraries are like shopping at Ikea.</strong> The home is already built; but you get to pick out the furniture for each room and arrange it how you want. <strong>Frameworks are more like buying a </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears_Modern_Homes\"><strong>Sears Home Kit</strong></a><strong>;</strong> the materials only fit together as defined in the blueprint and there’s not much room for creative input.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/465b1e409d20ca92cbafedcb7abdcbc9/href\">https://medium.com/media/465b1e409d20ca92cbafedcb7abdcbc9/href</a><h3>TypeScript</h3>\n<p>Besides being a framework, one of the things that makes Angular unique from <em>React</em> and <em>Vue</em> is the use of <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript.</a> TypeScript is a superset of Javascript that adds a property called type that locks in the specific data type for each construct (such as “string”, or “array”) and originated from the shortcomings of Javascript. In TypeScript, you might see something like this when defining a class:</p>\n<pre>state:string = 'District of Columbia'<br>active:boolean = false<br>breweries: Object;</pre>\n<p>As you can see, each piece of data has been assigned a specific datatype. Unlike regular Javascript, if you tried to set the value of state=0 you would get an error. In the long term, this is significantly more consistent and maintainable than type handling in regular JS.</p>\n<h3>CLI Component Generation</h3>\n<p>This was probably my favorite thing about Angular. By utilizing Angular’s CLI, you can generate new components via the command line. By typing the simple command, ng generate [componentName], the Angular CLI will initialize all the files required for that component, and place them in the appropriate directories (more on those files later). I love this feature! It reminds me of the Rails CLI generators for resources and migrations. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm all for automation.</p>\n<p>Note: Angular CLI Commands are prefixed with <strong>ng</strong> — for <em>aNGular.</em></p>\n<h3>Data Binding</h3>\n<p>This was a big one in my opinion. Data binding (state management) happens by default in an Angular app and does not require an external package like Redux or Flux. While this is extremely useful, I found the way in which the data was passed around to be a little convoluted.</p>\n<p>In React, if you wanted to iterate over a list of breweries you would .map() over this.state.array turning each object into a specified component. In Angular, the array would be stored in state and accessed using props prefixed with <strong>*ng</strong> - again, for <em>aNGular.</em></p>\n<pre>&lt;ul *ngIf=\"breweries\"&gt;<br>    &lt;li *ngFor=\"let brew of breweries\"&gt;<br>\t&lt;p class=\"name\"&gt;<br>            &lt;a <br>             href=\"{{ brew.website_url }}\"<br>             class=\"site\"&gt;{{ brew.name }}&lt;/a&gt;<br>        &lt;/p&gt;<br>\t&lt;p class=\"address\"&gt;{{ brew.street }}&lt;/p&gt;<br>\t&lt;p class=\"address\"&gt;{{ brew.address }}&lt;/p&gt;<br>    &lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>\n<p>While the above code does replace both a conditional JSX statement, and a .map(), I don't find this as readable as React syntax.</p>\n<pre>{ this.props.breweries ?<br>    &lt;ul&gt;<br>\t{ this.props.breweries.map(brew =&gt; &lt;Brewery {...brew}/&gt;) }<br>    &lt;/ul&gt;<br>: null }</pre>\n<h3>Routing</h3>\n<p>Routing is another big feature that comes built into Angular. Routing in Angular is handled via a Routes array, that is populated with key:value pairs representing the route, and the action.</p>\n<pre>const routes: Routes = [<br>\t{ path: '', component: Home },<br>\t{ path: 'breweries', component: Breweries },<br>\t{ path: 'about', component: About },<br>];<br>@NgModule({<br>  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],<br>  exports: [RouterModule]<br>})<br>export class AppRoutingModule { }</pre>\n<p>The route configuration is very straightforward, but I found it weird to have the routes stored in a separate module and then imported into the app itself. Maybe that’s just the React developer in me, though. Personally, I like how ReactRouter’s configuration works using the Switch component.</p>\n<h3>File Structure</h3>\n<p>One thing that particularly bothered me about Angular, was the file structure. When you run the CLI component generator, four files are generated. <em>Two TypeScript, one HTML, and one CSS.</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*OMzHpb0b_HGEeFWU.png\"><figcaption><em>FOUR files per component?! 😳</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each of these files does serve a specific purpose. One of the TypeScript files, <em>name.component.ts</em> is the definition of the Component itself and all of the logic behind that component; export default class YaddaYaddaYadda. The second TypeScript file, <em>name.component.specs.ts</em>, serves as the unit tests for that component. The file <em>name.component.html</em> serves as the <strong>view</strong> for the component—it's the render() method. And lastly, <em>name.component.css</em> is exactly what you'd expect, the styles.</p>\n<p>I know why the file structure bothered me; in React, I’m a styled-components guy. I’m already trying to get my components down to a single file containing all logic, helper functions, and styling. I’m already tired of jumping between a JS file and a CSS file, further separating the logic and the view doesn’t accomplish that goal for me. But then again, as I think about it more the separation of responsibility is one of the things that I appreciate most about rails; models, controllers, and views.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Do I like Angular? No. But do I hate Angular? No. I’m just not used to it yet. Everything I’ve read about Angular is that it has a significantly larger learning curve than React or Vue do; and I can see that. I think I’d have to work exclusively on Angular every day before I got the hang of it. After switching back to React for a few days, I forgot many of the intricacies of Angular.</p>\n<p>Will I use Angular again? Sure. But am I leaving my beloved React behind? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fafc5d84e025\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

      "description": "\n<p>Back in February, I took a trip to Denver (remember traveling?) and decided that I’d take the opportunity to bootstrap a Rails/React app on a plane see what happened. I had been meaning to revisit an old travel app idea using React and figured that 32,000 feet was the perfect place to start. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cakehole/cloud-computing-web-apps-at-altitude-bf3d3ffe6009?source=friends_link&amp;sk=782d6cbd5206082600b17c670771d55a\">It was a great learning experience</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the past weeks I’ve refactored the API a few times; rethinking basic relationships, adding models, securing endpoints. You know, standard development stuff. <em>Cloud computing</em> jokes aside, revisiting an old app idea has given me the opportunity to also revisit some stretch features that didn’t make the cut for my beta version.</p>\n<p>One of those stretch features was map integration. The app is a tool for planning group itineraries; so a map with pins representing milestone events remains a key selling point. <em>You don’t have to be a boy scout to know that if you’re lost in a new city the best thing you can do is reference a map to identify where you are, and where you need to be.</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/7a83ec6d1c913c69659757f55474242b/href\">https://medium.com/media/7a83ec6d1c913c69659757f55474242b/href</a><p>While appealing, the ability to visually see key milestones in map form was solely an improvement to the the <strong>user experience</strong>, and not the core functionality; so it was back-burnered<strong>.</strong> But I was excited to finally explore it.</p>\n<h4>Google Maps</h4>\n<p>I can’t talk about Mapbox without first talking about Google. Google is touted as the market leader in online mapping. Admittedly, it was hard to find firm stats on market share though because Google’s product covers so many markets. Some sources compared Google Maps with Apple Maps and Waze, which was not at all the market data I was looking for. Other sources others compared Google Maps to Mapquest, which I didn’t realize was <a href=\"https://www.mapquest.com/\">still a thing</a>.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/mapping-and-gis--121/google-maps-api-market-share\">undated analysis by Datanyze.com</a> reports that Google Maps’s <strong><em>free</em></strong> API service comes in first with 20% of market share for mobile mapping APIs. Google Map’s <strong><em>paid</em></strong> API services on the other hand, fall to sixth place holding only 0.87% of market share.</p>\n<p>Mapbox, by comparison, comes in second place with roughly 5% of market share.</p>\n<p>I decided to explore <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing\">Google’s offering</a> in more detail before making any decisions. It quickly became very clear why Google’s free services top the market. First, they’re free; who doesn’t love free? Second, the very limited free options are extremely simple to implement; static maps <em>(that’s all they offer)</em>. If all you need is a static map, boy does Google have a great deal for you!</p>\n<p>But wait, there’s some fine print under the word Free—<em>for mobile</em>—it’s not free for desktop devices?! Turns out at the free tier, Google charges $2 per 1000 requests from a non-mobile device. They want a credit card up front, but do appear to offer the same bonus $200 in credits for your first month that I encountered when exploring <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cakehole/amazon-web-services-416d64af57b8?source=friends_link&amp;sk=29eb11536b99a75949ebda59fa3888f3\">Google Cloud Services</a>.</p>\n<p>As someone looking to explore a mapping API through what would largely be trial and error, linking my credit card to a sandbox environment didn’t seem like a fiscally sound decision at this time. Sorry Google.</p>\n<h4>Mapbox</h4>\n<p>Mapbox is an alternative to Google maps. According to the <a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/mapping-and-gis--121/google-maps-api-market-share\">undated analysis</a> I referenced earlier, Mapbox is Google’s primary competitor—next in line is another Google product followed by a product <em>using the Google Maps API.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/\">Mapbox offers a generous free tier</a>, with every product offering basic free services. There are usage caps, but they’re large enough that you won’t reach them in a development environment.</p>\n<p>Using Mapbox is pretty straightforward, and thanks to their thorough documentation if you get stuck the answer isn’t far away. I followed this tutorial for using <a href=\"https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/use-mapbox-gl-js-with-react/\">Mapbox with React</a> and had a working map in no time. Working with geolocation data was somewhat new to me, I struggled a bit with parsing floating point numbers to the right precision, but Mapbox anticipated that and touched on it in the tutorial.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking that you’ve never seen a Mapbox map, you definitely have. Mapbox is used by many popular websites and applications. <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/showcase/\">Facebook, Snapchat, Hotels.com, Washington Post, and Jump Bikes</a> all use Mapbox.</p>\n<p>Uber, the owner of <em>Jump Bikes</em>, has actually built their own <a href=\"https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl\">React component library</a> for Mapbox. This component library made the Mapbox integration feel much more React-like, so I chose to refactor using <strong>react-map-gl</strong> entirely.</p>\n<h4>How do I know if I’m looking at a Mapbox map?</h4>\n<p>In my experience, <em>if it doesn’t look like Google Maps it’s probably </em><strong><em>Mapbox</em></strong><em>.</em> Mapbox is highly customizable allowing user to create maps with high visual contrast for custom use cases. They also offer a theme gallery in case predefined styles are more your thing; if not, the templates serve as a great source of creative inspiration.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vYAMgwGbbG5aov2EuLlinw.jpeg\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/#mineral\">Mineral Theme</a> for ©Mapbox</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, Google Maps does offer <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/styling\">customization</a> and <a href=\"https://snazzymaps.com/\">templates</a>, but people don’t seem to customize Google Maps; maybe it’s not part of the free tier? 🤔</p>\n<h4>Open Street Map</h4>\n<p>I have to give a shout out to <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a>, an open source project dedicated to free and available locally-sourced map data. Mapbox, would not be possible without all the hard work contributed by this dedicated worldwide community of mapping enthusiasts and humanitarians.</p>\n<p>OpenStreetMap also offers a handful mapping <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API\">API</a> solutions, all free, as long as you credit the project and it’s contributors.</p>\n<p>Even Mapbox credits <em>©OpenStreetMap</em> at the bottom of every map.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>Now that you’ve read this far, I have to come clean. I was always planning to use Mapbox for this project. Their east-coast headquarters is here in DC; they’re kind of hometown heroes around these parts.</p>\n<p>I’ve had the pleasure of meeting some of their team members at various events over the past few years; they are a smart group of dedicated people working to provide a powerful but flexible mapping solution—and they’re doing a great job.</p>\n<p>If you need to utilize Maps in your application, I can’t recommend Mapbox enough. Don’t believe me? Check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/builtwithmapbox?f=tweets\">#BuiltWithMapbox</a> to see what others are building with Mapbox.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7c203e93e75c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

The app is a tool for planning group itineraries; so a map with pins representing milestone events remains a key selling point. <em>You don’t have to be a boy scout to know that if you’re lost in a new city the best thing you can do is reference a map to identify where you are, and where you need to be.</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/7a83ec6d1c913c69659757f55474242b/href\">https://medium.com/media/7a83ec6d1c913c69659757f55474242b/href</a><p>While appealing, the ability to visually see key milestones in map form was solely an improvement to the the <strong>user experience</strong>, and not the core functionality; so it was back-burnered<strong>.</strong> But I was excited to finally explore it.</p>\n<h4>Google Maps</h4>\n<p>I can’t talk about Mapbox without first talking about Google. Google is touted as the market leader in online mapping. Admittedly, it was hard to find firm stats on market share though because Google’s product covers so many markets. Some sources compared Google Maps with Apple Maps and Waze, which was not at all the market data I was looking for. Other sources others compared Google Maps to Mapquest, which I didn’t realize was <a href=\"https://www.mapquest.com/\">still a thing</a>.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/mapping-and-gis--121/google-maps-api-market-share\">undated analysis by Datanyze.com</a> reports that Google Maps’s <strong><em>free</em></strong> API service comes in first with 20% of market share for mobile mapping APIs. Google Map’s <strong><em>paid</em></strong> API services on the other hand, fall to sixth place holding only 0.87% of market share.</p>\n<p>Mapbox, by comparison, comes in second place with roughly 5% of market share.</p>\n<p>I decided to explore <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing\">Google’s offering</a> in more detail before making any decisions. It quickly became very clear why Google’s free services top the market. First, they’re free; who doesn’t love free? Second, the very limited free options are extremely simple to implement; static maps <em>(that’s all they offer)</em>. If all you need is a static map, boy does Google have a great deal for you!</p>\n<p>But wait, there’s some fine print under the word Free—<em>for mobile</em>—it’s not free for desktop devices?! Turns out at the free tier, Google charges $2 per 1000 requests from a non-mobile device. They want a credit card up front, but do appear to offer the same bonus $200 in credits for your first month that I encountered when exploring <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cakehole/amazon-web-services-416d64af57b8?source=friends_link&amp;sk=29eb11536b99a75949ebda59fa3888f3\">Google Cloud Services</a>.</p>\n<p>As someone looking to explore a mapping API through what would largely be trial and error, linking my credit card to a sandbox environment didn’t seem like a fiscally sound decision at this time. Sorry Google.</p>\n<h4>Mapbox</h4>\n<p>Mapbox is an alternative to Google maps. According to the <a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/mapping-and-gis--121/google-maps-api-market-share\">undated analysis</a> I referenced earlier, Mapbox is Google’s primary competitor—next in line is another Google product followed by a product <em>using the Google Maps API.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/\">Mapbox offers a generous free tier</a>, with every product offering basic free services. There are usage caps, but they’re large enough that you won’t reach them in a development environment.</p>\n<p>Using Mapbox is pretty straightforward, and thanks to their thorough documentation if you get stuck the answer isn’t far away. I followed this tutorial for using <a href=\"https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/use-mapbox-gl-js-with-react/\">Mapbox with React</a> and had a working map in no time. Working with geolocation data was somewhat new to me, I struggled a bit with parsing floating point numbers to the right precision, but Mapbox anticipated that and touched on it in the tutorial.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking that you’ve never seen a Mapbox map, you definitely have. Mapbox is used by many popular websites and applications. <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/showcase/\">Facebook, Snapchat, Hotels.com, Washington Post, and Jump Bikes</a> all use Mapbox.</p>\n<p>Uber, the owner of <em>Jump Bikes</em>, has actually built their own <a href=\"https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl\">React component library</a> for Mapbox. This component library made the Mapbox integration feel much more React-like, so I chose to refactor using <strong>react-map-gl</strong> entirely.</p>\n<h4>How do I know if I’m looking at a Mapbox map?</h4>\n<p>In my experience, <em>if it doesn’t look like Google Maps it’s probably </em><strong><em>Mapbox</em></strong><em>.</em> Mapbox is highly customizable allowing user to create maps with high visual contrast for custom use cases. They also offer a theme gallery in case predefined styles are more your thing; if not, the templates serve as a great source of creative inspiration.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vYAMgwGbbG5aov2EuLlinw.jpeg\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/#mineral\">Mineral Theme</a> for ©Mapbox</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, Google Maps does offer <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/styling\">customization</a> and <a href=\"https://snazzymaps.com/\">templates</a>, but people don’t seem to customize Google Maps; maybe it’s not part of the free tier? 🤔</p>\n<h4>Open Street Map</h4>\n<p>I have to give a shout out to <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a>, an open source project dedicated to free and available locally-sourced map data. Mapbox, would not be possible without all the hard work contributed by this dedicated worldwide community of mapping enthusiasts and humanitarians.</p>\n<p>OpenStreetMap also offers a handful mapping <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API\">API</a> solutions, all free, as long as you credit the project and it’s contributors.</p>\n<p>Even Mapbox credits <em>©OpenStreetMap</em> at the bottom of every map.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>Now that you’ve read this far, I have to come clean. I was always planning to use Mapbox for this project. Their east-coast headquarters is here in DC; they’re kind of hometown heroes around these parts.</p>\n<p>I’ve had the pleasure of meeting some of their team members at various events over the past few years; they are a smart group of dedicated people working to provide a powerful but flexible mapping solution—and they’re doing a great job.</p>\n<p>If you need to utilize Maps in your application, I can’t recommend Mapbox enough. Don’t believe me? Check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/builtwithmapbox?f=tweets\">#BuiltWithMapbox</a> to see what others are building with Mapbox.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7c203e93e75c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

      "description": "\n<p>A few months ago, I published some <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cakehole/micro-blog-ive-been-struggling-with-getting-elements-to-be-where-i-want-them-in-an-app-i-m-47303c8de83b\">brief thoughts</a> about Flex and Grid. I had struggled with how to properly use these CSS models for a while and had finally found a resource that helped make it click for me.</p>\n<p>Since then I’ve worked on a few new projects and have had the opportunity to play around with each and really understand how they work. Before I share my new thoughts, I’d like to talk about some traditional graphic design principles.</p>\n<p>In college, I studied Graphic Media; it was kind of like graphic design, but the emphasis was designing for print output. Along with learning about design principles, typography, color theory, and workflow management, we learned a significant amount about printing technologies itself; substrates, ink types, and finishing techniques <em>(graphic design programs traditionally do not cover best practices for printing technologies)</em>. It was a Bachelor of Science program within the School of Art.</p>\n<p>Early in my studies I was exposed to a 1981 Swiss book called <a href=\"https://www.niggli.ch/en/grid-systems-in-graphic-design.html\"><strong>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</strong></a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_M%C3%BCller-Brockmann\"><strong><em>Josef Müller-Brockmann</em></strong></a><strong><em> (1914−1996)</em></strong><em>.</em> For decades, the book has served as a manual for graphic designers, typographers and three dimensional designers; providing a set of guidelines and rules for the the grid systems that have become accepted as a world wide standard.</p>\n<p>The book is by the industry, for the industry; Müller-Brockmann was 50 years into his career as a graphic designer, teacher, and architect when he published Grid Systems. <a href=\"https://www.shillingtoneducation.com/blog/josef-muller-brockmann-tbt/\">He’s a really fascinating guy</a>. My roommate, an Industrial Designer, owned a copy—it was a great book to have around as an aspiring typographer. I’ve since bought my own copy, a decision I’ve never regretted. I always refer back to it for both the content, and design inspiration.</p>\n<p>Along with being regarded as one of the most important books in the industry, the book is a work of art itself. Beautifully hard bound, the cover is the most recognizable shade of reddish orange, noticeable on a bookshelf from across the room. On the front, a white grid overlays the book’s title, typeset in both English and German—<strong>it’s foil stamped</strong>—perfectly set using the very principles outlined in the book. The type on the spine set simply yet elegantly, displaying in a small typeface, maybe 8 pt, the content perfectly aligned to the same grid from the cover. The back, an empty white grid mirroring the front.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y6c9125pNu_eFbZvWpYwyA.jpeg\"><figcaption>It’s Beautiful.</figcaption></figure><p>And yeah, that’s Helvetica. <strong><em>The Swiss love Helvetica.</em></strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ClSgmtyg4BHewOjLqbYBPQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>English Left / German Right</figcaption></figure><p>Inside, the content, like the cover, is written in half English and half German; the page is split in two columns with English on the left, and German on the right. The dual-language experience always reminds me of a trip I took to Switzerland years ago—everything is written in both English and German there.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OfEz7kXAZD6a5BLgdFIU3Q.jpeg\"><figcaption>Grid Examples</figcaption></figure><p>A large majority of pages showcase the exact grids used to design them, helping reinforce the concepts and principles being outlined—a must for visual learners.</p>\n<h4>Ok, great. It’s a well designed book. What’s this have to do with CSS?</h4>\n<p>I know, I know… Deep down inside I’m still a typography nerd.</p>\n<p>Trust me, I’m getting there.</p>\n<p>The reason that I wanted to talk about this book was that its principles have been the foundation of how I’ve approached design for years. The grid is as much a part of the design as the content is. As I started spending more time designing for web, I naturally used leaned to the same proven design principles I was taught and have been using for years; the grid.</p>\n<p>When designing for print output, the first step is to define the grid. So when it came time for styling an application, I took the same approach. After settling on my base grid, I spent hours trying to perfectly align my elements by spanning columns and calculating values based on other element sizes; <em>and</em> <em>then again for every screen size.</em></p>\n<p>I built <a href=\"https://www.kylepcole.com/hunger-swype\">Hunger Swype</a> entirely using grid. I refactored the grid three or four times, it just wasn’t flexible enough. At the end of the day I ended up with three primary base grids, based on screen size. For my app to be responsive, I had to style each element for each grid. It wasn’t ideal, but it worked. Now, though, as I add features, I have to style them thrice. 🤦🏼‍♂️</p>\n<p>While my traditional Grid System did work when applied for the web, it wasn’t that intuitive. On top of that, my grid itself was not responsive—I had just made multiple grids.</p>\n<p><em>Suddenly I was questioning whether I had even applied these core design principles at all, let alone properly.</em></p>\n<p>When styling my next app, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cakehole/introducing-expiration-an-exercise-in-situational-innovation-5d06634ac1cd\">expiRATION</a>, I opted for a slightly different approach. I had spent countless hours on Grid on my last project, but since had taken time to experiment with Flex. For this app I leaned on my training again and chose to define the base grid first; but this time I wanted a single, flexible, grid. This app was simple, an inventory tracker, so I set out to build my grid using only Flex.</p>\n<p>I found a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-flexbox-grids/\">tutorial</a> that pointed me in the right direction for making a basic grid with Flex. It turned out to be far easier than I expected, and I quickly implemented a grid for my list of items. It was less tedious than if I had used Grid to build the same layout. You could almost use the word <em>automated</em> in comparison when describing Flex.</p>\n<p><em>For what it’s worth, here’s a </em><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/\"><em>simple grid tutorial</em></a><em> by the same author.</em></p>\n<p>When using an <em>explicit grid</em> system, every element needed to be specifically positioned within that grids rows and columns. This gains control, but loses flexibility. Flex on the other hand doesn’t require explicit row and column definitions. If you put four items in a Flexbox, you’ll have four columns. Need to wrap to another row? flex-wrap can do that. It takes some time to get used to, but takes some of the thinking out of it once you do.</p>\n<p>If I had to pick my favorite thing about Flex, it would be how much easier responsive design becomes. My flex grid scaled <em>almost perfectly</em> to mobile screens, all I really had to change was add flex-direction: column; to stack the content vertically at smaller sizes.</p>\n<h4>Just always use Flex, right?</h4>\n<p>If that floats your boat, go ahead! Compared to Grid, Flex is, well… <em>flexible</em>. But compared to Flex, Grid is more <em>structured</em>. Does that mean that you should always use Flex when you need flexibility, and grid when you need structure? No, not necessarily.</p>\n<p>I mentioned the term <em>“explicit grid”</em> earlier. An <strong>explicit grid</strong> is a grid defined with grid-template-column or grid-template-row. Explicit grids are great when you know exactly where you want every element positioned. This was the approach I took with Hunger Swype.</p>\n<p>Grids can be designed to have more flexibility, but in doing so you sacrifice structure. If you define a grid using grid-auto-columns or grid-auto-rows, you’re using an <strong>implicit grid</strong>. Implicit grids will have their rows/columns auto-sized to contain the content accordingly.</p>\n<p>If you really want to get crazy, <strong>explicit</strong> and <strong>implicit</strong> grids can be <strong><em>used together</em></strong> to create highly flexible layouts with fixed rows and flexible columns, or vice-versa.</p>\n<h4>So what’s best?</h4>\n<p>I’m no expert, but my opinion is that both Flex and Grid are very powerful CSS models, and both serve multiple purposes. It really comes down to a design decision; how do you as the designer want to display the information and how much control do you need. As I further explore grid systems in web design, I’m rethinking my approach to designing with grid systems in general.</p>\n<p>I’ve actually thought back to another book I read in college—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media\"><strong>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</strong></a>, by <strong><em>Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980)</em></strong>. McLuhan, a Canadian philosopher of media theory, coined the expression <strong>the medium is the message</strong>, <em>a theory that a communication medium itself holds a greater impact than the content it provides. </em>The book is way ahead of its time for 1964, and the parallels to modern media are shocking.</p>\n<p><em>McLuhan also accurately predicted the personal computer and world wide web in his 1962 book, </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy\"><em>The Gutenberg Galaxy</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>The reason that McLuhan came to mind is because I have been designing for new mediums as I shift into web development. If McLuhan is correct that the medium itself <em>is</em> the message, then the <em>message</em> <em>is different</em> for each unique medium. <strong>Shouldn’t this be true for our design principles?</strong> What held true for print doesn’t necessarily work on the web (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color\"><em>additive</em></a><em> vs. </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color\"><em>subtractive</em></a><em> color, for example</em>). And what works on the web, might not translate to mobile.</p>\n<p>While the old school principles of the past will always serve as the backbone for current industry best practices, industries change and so should those best practices.</p>\n<p>The real trick is learning how to adapt the proven principles to work with modern mediums. I still figuring out how to best architect my own grid systems with CSS. If you have any tips or tricks that you use, I’d love to hear them.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=971ff6d4df09\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

If McLuhan is correct that the medium itself <em>is</em> the message, then the <em>message</em> <em>is different</em> for each unique medium. <strong>Shouldn’t this be true for our design principles?</strong> What held true for print doesn’t necessarily work on the web (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color\"><em>additive</em></a><em> vs. </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color\"><em>subtractive</em></a><em> color, for example</em>). And what works on the web, might not translate to mobile.</p>\n<p>While the old school principles of the past will always serve as the backbone for current industry best practices, industries change and so should those best practices.</p>\n<p>The real trick is learning how to adapt the proven principles to work with modern mediums. I still figuring out how to best architect my own grid systems with CSS. If you have any tips or tricks that you use, I’d love to hear them.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=971ff6d4df09\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

      "description": "\n<p>If you’ve used the internet in the past two decades, you’ve definitely come across term <strong>RSS Feed</strong>. Like most people, you likely brushed passed RSS as a fancy push notification integration you didn’t need because you already had a web browser handy. At best, you might have tried that OS X screensaver one time—linking it to your favorite Wired.com tech keyword <em>(Apparently that’s not even a default OS X screensaver anymore)</em>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/768/1*TIWOSDmJ7pMz4bve46O7Eg.png\"><figcaption>Is this like CSS or something?</figcaption></figure><h3>What is RSS?</h3>\n<p>Officially, RSS stands for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework\"><em>RDF</em></a><em> Site Summary</em>; but the technology has also adopted the backronyms <em>Rich Site Summary</em> and <em>Really Simple Syndication</em> over the years. It was created in March 1999 by Netscape (remember them?) as a way to source data to their My.Netscape.Com portal. After Netscape’s acquisition by AOL in 2001, support of RSS was suspended and several independent organizations took over maintaining the technology.</p>\n<p>In the simplest terms, RSS is a web-standard for easily delivering syndicated content through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\">XML</a>-formatted plain text to other applications. RSS feeds work much like your Facebook news feed does. You <em>subscribe</em> to a feed (<em>follow</em> a Facebook Page) and that feed’s content is automatically added to your news aggregator (your news feed).</p>\n<blockquote>Subscribing to a website RSS removes the need for the user to manually check the website for new content. Instead, their browser constantly monitors the feed(s) and informs the user of any updates through an aggregator. (source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">wikipedia</a>)</blockquote>\n<p>If you had asked me last week, I would have told you that RSS was a relic of the past. “<em>The web is all JSON now.”</em> I would have said confidently. I would have made an argument about the internet speeds in the 1990’s and early 2000’s and how it made sense to deliver a text feed over the internet instead of a website. I’d acknowledge that we have significantly faster internet today, and use that as a basis for my argument that that nobody uses RSS feeds anymore. This week though, I would have to admit I was wrong. Albeit only partially.</p>\n<p>Over the past 15 or so years, there has been far less interest in RSS feeds. With the rise of social media, brands have shifted to the “subscribe/follow” model. Instead of offering their content via an RSS feed they tailor their content and distribute it across various platforms. Even Google doesn’t like RSS anymore; they discontinued Google Reader back in July 2013 citing declining use — <strong>and that product didn’t even provide content. It was literally too much overhead to run the server.</strong></p>\n<h3>How is RSS used in 2020?</h3>\n<p>Well, it’s use hasn’t changed at all. Today, RSS is still used to deliver content, we just don’t hear about it that much. RSS feeds are the best way to get a complete look at a site’s new content — not just the stuff that gets pushed up on social media. The social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, all have algorithms that decide what users see. A signifiant of that is based on what <em>other people</em> have viewed—what’s trending.</p>\n<p>What an RSS feed can do that social medial cannot is provide you with a bias-free timeline of every single article the Washington Post has published. Articles won’t be filtered because it’s content somehow violates Twitter’s terms of service. Facebook wont show you the same article 3 times because your Aunt, former co-worker, and friend from elementary school thought it was worth a thumbs up. You won’t see the post about Acme Corp’s latest charitable donation that they paid instagram to place at the top of your feed.</p>\n<p>If it’s such a great way to get content, why don’t companies push their RSS feeds anymore? <strong>Page views. Likes. Follows. Retweets. </strong>The focus of these companies has shifted from delivering a story reliably to as many consumers<strong> </strong>as possible to having the most trending, or viral, content. <em>(Personally, I feel this has also had a negative affect on the </em><strong><em>quality</em></strong><em> of our news content, but I digress…)</em></p>\n<h3>RSS Readers Today</h3>\n<p>There are still many RSS readers around today that serve the original purpose of aggregating news into a single feed. On top of that, most websites still support the RSS protocol even if they don’t talk about it.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the more popular ones from 2019 in no particular order:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/welcome\"><strong>Feedly</strong></a><strong>:</strong> a simple interface with basic categories, as well as a home page filled with the latest news from all sources. This is currently one of the most popular feed readers online.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedreader.com/\"><strong>Feedreader</strong></a><strong>: </strong>a simple, minimalistic reader that supports basic categorization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\"><strong>Flipboard</strong></a><strong>:</strong> a beautifully designed reader that looks great on mobile devices. Recommend for those wanting a more visual experience.</p>\n<h3>What else can I do with RSS?</h3>\n<p>Since we now know that RSS is essentially a curated data feed, what else can we do with the data besides aggregate it? Well, the possibilities are endless. You could parse the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/new.rss\">Reddit RSS</a> feed of new posts for keywords so that you can be the first to comment. You could use the <a href=\"https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/search/msa?format=rss\">Craigslist RSS</a> feed to watch competing listings and make sure your item is the best priced one on the market. Theoretically, you could use an RSS feed to make a clone of the <a href=\"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml\">New York Times</a> to get around their paywall, but that would be unethical.</p>\n<p>Once cool thing that I recently did with an RSS feed was convert it to JSON in order to import it into my React application. Sure, I could have tried to parse the XML from the feed directly, but I decided that JSON was a better approach.</p>\n<p>How do you convert RSS to JSON? Great Question. I found two main approaches to converting RSS, online and local.</p>\n<h4>Online:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://rss2json.com/\">RSS 2 JSON</a> is an online RSS to JSON converter. From the website you can enter an RSS feed URL and then download the JSON content. This is great or a one time conversion, but what if you needed to convert the RSS on the fly? Good news, they also have an API. The API has a free tier that has some usage limits, and API keys can be issued for a higher request rate.</p>\n<p>To use the free tier of the API, prefix the RSS feed URL with the following, and make a fetch request to the combined URL. The result will be a JSON representation of the RSS feed. It probably won’t be pretty, but with the right massaging you’ll be able to use the content. <a href=\"https://rss2json.com/docs\">See the docs for adding API key params as needed.</a></p>\n<pre>https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url='RSS_FEED_URL_HERE'</pre>\n<h4>Local:</h4>\n<p>If you don’t like the API approach or you need to make a lot of requests and don’t want to pay for an API key you could use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-to-json\">rss-to-json</a> npm package to do the RSS to JSON conversion within your app itself. It works more or less the same way as the API does, except you feed the RSS feed URL into a function which returns the JSON output.</p>\n<pre>var Feed <strong>=</strong> require('rss-to-json')<br>Feed.load('RSS_FEED_URL_HERE', function(err, rss){<br>    console.log(rss)<br>})</pre>\n<h3>Should You Use RSS?</h3>\n<p>Yes. RSS was developed to serve a very specific purpose, and I believe that purpose still exists today. The need to quickly transmit text across the internet will never go away, so I don’t expect that RSS is going anywhere anytime soon. Plus, the ability to automatically monitor a feed for updates is unmatched with a Javascript Fetch.</p>\n<p>I never really got into RSS back in to the day, but after doing some research into RSS, I plan to actually try out an RSS reader myself and attempt to curate my own news as an exercise. Will it change the way I <em>consume</em> my news on a whole, probably not. But at least I’ll have a better understanding of the technology as a whole.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=93b8efb149d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

You <em>subscribe</em> to a feed (<em>follow</em> a Facebook Page) and that feed’s content is automatically added to your news aggregator (your news feed).</p>\n<blockquote>Subscribing to a website RSS removes the need for the user to manually check the website for new content. Instead, their browser constantly monitors the feed(s) and informs the user of any updates through an aggregator. (source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">wikipedia</a>)</blockquote>\n<p>If you had asked me last week, I would have told you that RSS was a relic of the past. “<em>The web is all JSON now.”</em> I would have said confidently. I would have made an argument about the internet speeds in the 1990’s and early 2000’s and how it made sense to deliver a text feed over the internet instead of a website. I’d acknowledge that we have significantly faster internet today, and use that as a basis for my argument that that nobody uses RSS feeds anymore. This week though, I would have to admit I was wrong. Albeit only partially.</p>\n<p>Over the past 15 or so years, there has been far less interest in RSS feeds. With the rise of social media, brands have shifted to the “subscribe/follow” model. Instead of offering their content via an RSS feed they tailor their content and distribute it across various platforms. Even Google doesn’t like RSS anymore; they discontinued Google Reader back in July 2013 citing declining use — <strong>and that product didn’t even provide content. It was literally too much overhead to run the server.</strong></p>\n<h3>How is RSS used in 2020?</h3>\n<p>Well, it’s use hasn’t changed at all. Today, RSS is still used to deliver content, we just don’t hear about it that much. RSS feeds are the best way to get a complete look at a site’s new content — not just the stuff that gets pushed up on social media. The social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, all have algorithms that decide what users see. A signifiant of that is based on what <em>other people</em> have viewed—what’s trending.</p>\n<p>What an RSS feed can do that social medial cannot is provide you with a bias-free timeline of every single article the Washington Post has published. Articles won’t be filtered because it’s content somehow violates Twitter’s terms of service. Facebook wont show you the same article 3 times because your Aunt, former co-worker, and friend from elementary school thought it was worth a thumbs up. You won’t see the post about Acme Corp’s latest charitable donation that they paid instagram to place at the top of your feed.</p>\n<p>If it’s such a great way to get content, why don’t companies push their RSS feeds anymore? <strong>Page views. Likes. Follows. Retweets. </strong>The focus of these companies has shifted from delivering a story reliably to as many consumers<strong> </strong>as possible to having the most trending, or viral, content. <em>(Personally, I feel this has also had a negative affect on the </em><strong><em>quality</em></strong><em> of our news content, but I digress…)</em></p>\n<h3>RSS Readers Today</h3>\n<p>There are still many RSS readers around today that serve the original purpose of aggregating news into a single feed. On top of that, most websites still support the RSS protocol even if they don’t talk about it.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the more popular ones from 2019 in no particular order:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/welcome\"><strong>Feedly</strong></a><strong>:</strong> a simple interface with basic categories, as well as a home page filled with the latest news from all sources. This is currently one of the most popular feed readers online.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedreader.com/\"><strong>Feedreader</strong></a><strong>: </strong>a simple, minimalistic reader that supports basic categorization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\"><strong>Flipboard</strong></a><strong>:</strong> a beautifully designed reader that looks great on mobile devices. Recommend for those wanting a more visual experience.</p>\n<h3>What else can I do with RSS?</h3>\n<p>Since we now know that RSS is essentially a curated data feed, what else can we do with the data besides aggregate it? Well, the possibilities are endless. You could parse the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/new.rss\">Reddit RSS</a> feed of new posts for keywords so that you can be the first to comment. You could use the <a href=\"https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/search/msa?format=rss\">Craigslist RSS</a> feed to watch competing listings and make sure your item is the best priced one on the market. Theoretically, you could use an RSS feed to make a clone of the <a href=\"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml\">New York Times</a> to get around their paywall, but that would be unethical.</p>\n<p>Once cool thing that I recently did with an RSS feed was convert it to JSON in order to import it into my React application. Sure, I could have tried to parse the XML from the feed directly, but I decided that JSON was a better approach.</p>\n<p>How do you convert RSS to JSON? Great Question. I found two main approaches to converting RSS, online and local.</p>\n<h4>Online:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://rss2json.com/\">RSS 2 JSON</a> is an online RSS to JSON converter. From the website you can enter an RSS feed URL and then download the JSON content. This is great or a one time conversion, but what if you needed to convert the RSS on the fly? Good news, they also have an API. The API has a free tier that has some usage limits, and API keys can be issued for a higher request rate.</p>\n<p>To use the free tier of the API, prefix the RSS feed URL with the following, and make a fetch request to the combined URL. The result will be a JSON representation of the RSS feed. It probably won’t be pretty, but with the right massaging you’ll be able to use the content. <a href=\"https://rss2json.com/docs\">See the docs for adding API key params as needed.</a></p>\n<pre>https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url='RSS_FEED_URL_HERE'</pre>\n<h4>Local:</h4>\n<p>If you don’t like the API approach or you need to make a lot of requests and don’t want to pay for an API key you could use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-to-json\">rss-to-json</a> npm package to do the RSS to JSON conversion within your app itself. It works more or less the same way as the API does, except you feed the RSS feed URL into a function which returns the JSON output.</p>\n<pre>var Feed <strong>=</strong> require('rss-to-json')<br>Feed.load('RSS_FEED_URL_HERE', function(err, rss){<br>    console.log(rss)<br>})</pre>\n<h3>Should You Use RSS?</h3>\n<p>Yes. RSS was developed to serve a very specific purpose, and I believe that purpose still exists today. The need to quickly transmit text across the internet will never go away, so I don’t expect that RSS is going anywhere anytime soon. Plus, the ability to automatically monitor a feed for updates is unmatched with a Javascript Fetch.</p>\n<p>I never really got into RSS back in to the day, but after doing some research into RSS, I plan to actually try out an RSS reader myself and attempt to curate my own news as an exercise. Will it change the way I <em>consume</em> my news on a whole, probably not. But at least I’ll have a better understanding of the technology as a whole.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=93b8efb149d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

Each approach has it’s own pros and cons, and some are suited better for specific purposes than others. This post will not cover every possible approach to styling components in React — there are far too many to cover them all. What I will cover in this post are my three favorite ways to style components, and when or why I use them.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*np-yQBMSpsrKxBS_mlCpwA.jpeg\"><figcaption>So chic.</figcaption></figure><p>Before we get started, let’s recap what a <strong>component</strong> is in React. According to the official React docs, <em>“Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.”</em> In their most basic form, Components are HTML elements. And like any HTML element, we apply styling to them via CSS (or SASS/SCSS).</p>\n<h3>1. Inline Styling</h3>\n<p>Inline styling is the most basic way to apply a style to a react component. Like inline styling in HTML, the styles are applied directly inline when creating the element. Styles do not live in an external file, and classes are not used.</p>\n<p>In React, inline styles are applied using the style prop. The style prop accepts a JSX Object containing the camelCase equivalent of the CSS properties as key/value pairs. If you wanted set a CSS property of an element to be background-color: red; you would use backgroundColor: \"red\", in the style object.</p>\n<pre>export default function MyComponent() {<br>    return(<br>      &lt;div style={{ <br>        background-color: \"red\", <br>        font-size: '2rem'<br>      }}&gt;Component Content&lt;/div&gt;<br>    )<br>}</pre>\n<p>Most developers will tell you to stay away from inline styling for a number of reasons. For starters, every element has to be individually styled; even if they look the same. If you ever need to change the style of those elements you better buckle up, because you’re going to be there a while. Also, they cannot be overridden easily.</p>\n<p>My recommendation follows this best practice. Steer clear of inline styling unless you absolutely have to (but you shouldn’t ever have to).</p>\n<h3>2. Class Names and CSS</h3>\n<p>This has been my go to method for years, long before learning React. By applying class names to components you are able to group similar elements together under a unified style. All elements with a given class name, will have the same styles and behavior applied to them. These styles are then defined in an external style sheet using CSS (or SASS/SCSS, if you’re into that) which is linked to the PWA through the html header. To assign a class name in react, pass the component a prop of className that is equal to the class you wish to assign.</p>\n<pre>export default function MyComponent() {<br>    return(<br>      &lt;div className=\"my-styled-component\"&gt;Component Content&lt;/div&gt;<br>    )<br>}</pre>\n<p>In your style sheet you’ll then define the CSS for that class and all elements with the class name of my-styled-component will have the following styles applied.</p>\n<pre>.my-styled-component {<br>    background-color: red;<br>    font-size: 3rem;<br>}</pre>\n<p>This approach works very well for managing different component types across an application, especially if you’re utilizing SCSS/SASS to work with variables or nest your styles. One downside to this approach is that by giving every single component a unique class name, you now have a lot of class names to keep up with. When the time comes to update or redesign the component you have to open Component.js and identify the className and then go over to your App.scss file, locate the class name and then make your changes. The extra step doesn’t seem that bad, until you’re undergoing a full redesign.</p>\n<h3>3. Styled Components</h3>\n<p>A new approach that I recently learned is <a href=\"https://styled-components.com/\">Styled Components</a>. Styled Components is a node package that lets you add styling to Component.js without using inline styles. You still define the styles just like you would in an external CSS file, but they’re not separate. This is a huge time saver when it comes time to update a component as you don’t have to jump across multiple files.</p>\n<p>Styled Components is pretty straight forward to use. Once imported, you create a const and assign it to styled.[html-element-type]. Styled Components will turn that const into a React component with the specified styles applied to it. You can then return that component as you would any other component. <strong><em>Note: Styled Components takes the actual CSS properties, not camelCased like React inline styling does.</em></strong></p>\n<pre>import styled from 'styled-components'<br>const MyStyledComponent = styled.div`<br> display:flex;<br> width: 90%;<br> margin: auto;<br> text-align: left;<br>`<br>export default function MyComponent() {<br>    return(<br>      &lt;MyStyledComponent&gt;<br>        Component Content<br>      &lt;MyStyledComponent/&gt;<br>    )<br>}</pre>\n<p>One really cool thing about Styled Components is that it allows you to change the style based on props. Using JSX within your styled component, you could apply a dynamic style to the component: color: ${props =&gt; props.primary ? \"red\" : \"white\"}. Sure, you could also do this with class names: className={ props.primary ? \"red-div\" : \"white-div\" } but again, that’s two more class names to manage in your CSS.</p>\n<p>If you have installed node-sass in your application, then Styled Components will accept SASS/SCSS in addition to CSS. However, one downside I’ve discovered to Styled Components is that SASS variables no longer work globally—they only work in the component in which they are defined.</p>\n<p>Since variables are one of the primary reasons I love SASS, that was almost a deal breaker for me. Then I discovered that Styled Components has a <a href=\"https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced\">ThemeProvider</a> that allows you to create a theme and share across your components—basically the exact thing that SASS variables provides. I still need a little more practice with ThemeProvider as it’s a little counter-intuitive IMO, but we’re getting there.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s how I’m styling these days. As with everything coding, I’m sure I’ll be doing it differently in a month once I learn something new. There’s actually a package called <a href=\"https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.1.1\">JSS</a> that I’m very interested in trying—it is very similar to Styled Components where the styles are written directly in Component.js but the syntax is closer to JavaScript (camelCased, nested objects) and also utilizes class names again. I’ll report back on that once I try it out.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2622cf8d9c7e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

That is the HTML onerror attribute. <strong><em>The HTML </em></strong><strong><em>onerror attribute fires a callback function when an error occurs while loading an external file. </em></strong>That means that if an error occurs (such as the resource can’t be found), the onerror function will be invoked. In that function you can specify an action, such as setting the source of the events target, which is the element itself.</p>\n<pre>&lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" onerror=\"myFunction()\" /&gt;</pre>\n<pre>&lt;script&gt;<br>function myFunction(event) {<br>  event.target.src = \"fallback.jpg\"<br>}<br>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p><strong><em>Author’s Note:</em></strong><em> If using ReactJS, the </em><em>onerror attribute can be added with JSX by passing a prop of </em><em>onError={ event =&gt; event.target.src=\"default.jpg\" } to your component.</em></p>\n<p>The onerror attribute can be added to the following <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp\">semantic HTML</a> tags: &lt;audio&gt;,&lt;body&gt;,&lt;embed&gt;,&lt;img&gt;,&lt;link&gt;,&lt;object&gt;,&lt;script&gt;,&lt;video&gt;. I was surprised to see link on that list given that I don’t generally think of links as ‘media’ elements, but it makes complete sense that they support this attribute. If an external link has been taken down, you don’t want to send your users to it.</p>\n<p>Designing web applications with proper error handling will most definitely lead to fewer bugs later on. Now that you know a few ways to handle errors when referencing external media will allow you can better code around the problem up front, and hopefully reduce your headaches later.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d998a3bb0960\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

In JavaScript we could write a function to check if the local file can be required and return a boolean value <em>(Node actually has a builtin </em><em>.exists() function)</em>.</p>\n<pre>let image = data.image</pre>\n<pre>function fileExists(file){<br>    return require(file) //this will return a boolean<br>}</pre>\n<pre>fileExists(image) // =&gt; true/false</pre>\n<p>The downside this function is that it doesn’t provide a fallback value. It simply returns true/false and then then you have to actually error handle the missing image elsewhere.</p>\n<p>We could also use a try...catch statement render the file, and then catch the error if and when it happens.</p>\n<pre>let image = data.image</pre>\n<pre>try {<br> renderExternalFile(file)<br>}<br>catch(e) {<br> console.error(e)<br>}</pre>\n<p>This approach still requires some sort of error handling. Now, you could add a ...finally in there to handle that by reassigning the image variable and then returning the element, but that’s a lot of steps.</p>\n<pre>let image = data.image</pre>\n<pre>try {<br> renderExternalFile(file) <br>}<br>catch(e) {<br>  console.error(e)<br>  file = \"fallback.jpg\"<br>}<br>finally {<br> return renderExternalFile(file)<br>}</pre>\n<p>We could use a switch statement to compares the data with all the possible combinations and return a default when there is no match. This is actually even more steps now… 🤦🏼‍♂️</p>\n<pre>switch(data.image) {<br> case \"option1\":<br>   return \"image1.png\"<br> case \"option2\":<br>   return \"image2.png\"<br> case \"option3\":<br>   return \"image4.png\"<br> default:<br>   return \"fallback.jpg\"</pre>\n<p>While all of these approaches will work with enough fine tuning, I recently learned one trick that is not only less code, but seems to work more reliably. That is the HTML onerror attribute. <strong><em>The HTML </em></strong><strong><em>onerror attribute fires a callback function when an error occurs while loading an external file. </em></strong>That means that if an error occurs (such as the resource can’t be found), the onerror function will be invoked. In that function you can specify an action, such as setting the source of the events target, which is the element itself.</p>\n<pre>&lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" onerror=\"myFunction()\" /&gt;</pre>\n<pre>&lt;script&gt;<br>function myFunction(event) {<br>  event.target.src = \"fallback.jpg\"<br>}<br>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p><strong><em>Author’s Note:</em></strong><em> If using ReactJS, the </em><em>onerror attribute can be added with JSX by passing a prop of </em><em>onError={ event =&gt; event.target.src=\"default.jpg\" } to your component.</em></p>\n<p>The onerror attribute can be added to the following <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp\">semantic HTML</a> tags: &lt;audio&gt;,&lt;body&gt;,&lt;embed&gt;,&lt;img&gt;,&lt;link&gt;,&lt;object&gt;,&lt;script&gt;,&lt;video&gt;. I was surprised to see link on that list given that I don’t generally think of links as ‘media’ elements, but it makes complete sense that they support this attribute. If an external link has been taken down, you don’t want to send your users to it.</p>\n<p>Designing web applications with proper error handling will most definitely lead to fewer bugs later on. Now that you know a few ways to handle errors when referencing external media will allow you can better code around the problem up front, and hopefully reduce your headaches later.</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d998a3bb0960\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

I proceeded to apply a .sort() to the data but pretty quickly determined that Fri, 27 Mar 2020 12:00:00 UTC +00:00 was not a format that was going to work for this app. I had a flashback to my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cakehole/new-date-datetime-new-time-now-3e7a99c3ff8b\">last experience with date-times</a> — I really wanted the app to say <em>“Expiring Tomorrow” </em>but didn’t really want to calculate how many days in the future an event was; that was a can of worms I wasn’t ready to open.</p>\n<p>Thats when I remembered about <a href=\"https://momentjs.com/\">Moment.js</a>, a javascript package that was recommended to me after building my travel app and struggling with the conversion of all date-times to milliseconds to pass them between Ruby and Javascript. I had looked at the package documentation briefly, but had never actually implemented it.</p>\n<p>Moment.js works very much like the default Date object in Javascript, you instantiate a new Moment with an optional argument of a date-time value. If no value is provided, a date-time object representing the current date-time will be created. Moment objects have various methods that can be called on them that affect the returned value:</p>\n<pre><strong>Format Dates<br></strong>moment().format(‘MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a’);<br>     // March 29th 2020, 7:25:52 pm<br>moment().format(‘dddd’);<br>     // Sunday<br>moment().format(“MMM Do YY”);<br>     // Mar 29th 20<br>moment().format();<br>     // 2020–03–29T19:25:52–04:00</pre>\n<pre><strong>Relative Time<br></strong>moment(“20111031”, “YYYYMMDD”).fromNow();<br>     // 8 years ago<br>moment().startOf(‘day’).fromNow();<br>     // 19 hours ago<br>moment().endOf(‘day’).fromNow();<br>     // in 5 hours<br>moment().startOf(‘hour’).fromNow();<br>     // 26 minutes ago</pre>\n<pre><strong>Calendar/Time Math<br></strong>moment().subtract(10, ‘days’);<br>     // 03/19/2020<br>moment().subtract(6, ‘days’).calendar();<br>     // Last Monday at 7:25 PM<br>moment().subtract(3, ‘days’).calendar();<br>     // Last Thursday at 7:25 PM<br>moment().subtract(1, ‘days’).calendar();<br>     // Yesterday at 7:25 PM<br>moment().calendar();<br>     // Today at 7:25 PM<br>moment().add(1, ‘days’).calendar();<br>     // Tomorrow at 7:25 PM<br>moment().add(3, ‘days’).calendar();<br>     // Wednesday at 7:25 PM<br>moment().add(10, ‘days’).calendar();</pre>\n<pre><strong>Comparisons</strong><br>moment('2020-03-29').isSame('2020-03-29');<br>     //true<br>moment('2010-10-20').isBefore('2010-10-21');<br>     // true<br>moment('2010-10-20').isAfter('2010-10-19');<br>     // true</pre>\n<p>These formatting methods changed the game when creating this app! Using Moment.js allowed me to very easily display the number of days until something expired without having to get into complex date-time math.

      "description": "\n<p>I recently took a trip to Denver to get some skiing in before the season was over. As I boarded my first leg from DCA &gt; DAL I realized that my aircraft did not have passenger entertainment systems in every seat; this was a long flight and I was on my own.</p>\n<p>Shortly after takeoff there was that unmistakable <strong><em>*ding*</em></strong> followed by the announcement; <em>“Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached 10,000 feet; you may now use your approved electronic devices.” — </em>out comes my laptop.</p>\n<p>After roughly 2 minutes of browsing through Southwest’s live TV offerings; sitcom re-runs from my youth; non-stop CNN or ESPN coverage; daytime soaps in a variety of languages—I determined there wasn’t any content for me. Naturally, I decided to write a little sky-code instead (a new kind of cloud-computing).</p>\n<p>A few months ago I built a single-page application called <a href=\"https://www.kylepcole.com/flytinerary\">Flytinerary</a>. It’s an app to help plan and track itinerary items when traveling as a group. The idea actually stemmed from planning this very ski trip with my buddies. The app was never fully complete (they never are) so I had always intended to revisit it. It’s written in vanilla JavaScript, and ever since learning React I had been planning to rebuild the entire application anyways.</p>\n<p>So there I was, on an airplane, taking the very trip that first prompted my travel app, looking to code something.

      "content": "\n<p>I recently took a trip to Denver to get some skiing in before the season was over. As I boarded my first leg from DCA &gt; DAL I realized that my aircraft did not have passenger entertainment systems in every seat; this was a long flight and I was on my own.</p>\n<p>Shortly after takeoff there was that unmistakable <strong><em>*ding*</em></strong> followed by the announcement; <em>“Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached 10,000 feet; you may now use your approved electronic devices.” — </em>out comes my laptop.</p>\n<p>After roughly 2 minutes of browsing through Southwest’s live TV offerings; sitcom re-runs from my youth; non-stop CNN or ESPN coverage; daytime soaps in a variety of languages—I determined there wasn’t any content for me. Naturally, I decided to write a little sky-code instead (a new kind of cloud-computing).</p>\n<p>A few months ago I built a single-page application called <a href=\"https://www.kylepcole.com/flytinerary\">Flytinerary</a>. It’s an app to help plan and track itinerary items when traveling as a group. The idea actually stemmed from planning this very ski trip with my buddies. The app was never fully complete (they never are) so I had always intended to revisit it. It’s written in vanilla JavaScript, and ever since learning React I had been planning to rebuild the entire application anyways.</p>\n<p>So there I was, on an airplane, taking the very trip that first prompted my travel app, looking to code something.

      "description": "\n<p>If you’ve ever had any exposure to web design, or software engineering you’ve probably been exposed to some sort of framework. Regardless of whether you were working with <a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">Material</a>, <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"https://semantic-ui.com/\">Semantic UI</a>, or <a href=\"https://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a>— they all work largely the same way. The basic concept behind most major frameworks (particularly CSS frameworks) is:</p>\n<blockquote>if you use a predefined element structure in your HTML, and those elements have specific predefined CSS classes, then your web page will display in a fancy way.</blockquote>\n<p>In its most basic form, a CSS framework is essentially a collection of CSS stylesheets that are tailored for use in common situations, like setting up menu bars, buttons, and forms.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A sample of a Semantic UI card component.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/628/1*dpQI218WBE3JneITSdwUfw.png\"><figcaption>Hi Kristy 👋</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How do you use a framework?</strong></p>\n<p>When the time came to implement a framework in your web app, you likely started out by looking through the documentation for one of the more popular frameworks like Bootstrap or Semantic for some styled elements that you wanted to reuse. Once you found one you liked, you clicked a button that said <em>“Try Me” </em>or <em>“View Code”</em> and were then presented with a HTML template.</p>\n<p>For example, Semantic has something called a 'card' which you’ve probably seen all over the internet (looks kind of like Facebook, eh?).</p>\n<p>The HTML code for a card is as follows:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HTML syntax for creating a Card component.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/902/1*yJAG_Jv79UVwYWpa5t4tkA.png\"></figure><p>Wow, that’s a lot of code for a glorified image with a caption.</p>\n<p>Ok, well, if I want to use this element then I guess I have no choice but to copy this code verbatim and change the content to match my needs. I then need to make sure that I import the supporting CSS styles from a CDN (and no, that’s not code from Canada) so that all these class names can get adequately styled.</p>\n<pre>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.4.2/dist/semantic.min.css\"&gt;</pre>\n<p>Alright so now that you’ve copied the HTML template and imported the stylesheet your card looks great! Now it’s time to style the rest of the cards within your app. Go ahead and copy &amp; paste the HTML template again, now update all the content. I’ll wait…</p>\n<p>Wow, those look fantastic! Oh, you wanted them to display in a nice grid layout? Well why didn’t you say so—that’s a <strong><em>different</em></strong> HTML template. Better go back and rework those other cards now.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you’ve decided by now to use some OO Javascript principles (or even better, React) to help manage this process. If not, you should rethink your app design immediately; <em>that’s a </em><strong><em>huge</em></strong><em> </em><em>.html file dude.</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/64136941fdd9dcbe1d89186bdb75b42b/href\">https://medium.com/media/64136941fdd9dcbe1d89186bdb75b42b/href</a><p>Great, now that you’ve refactored your app to have some sense of hierarchy it’s time to start building out the rest of our app using more HTML templates with even more classes. We just need a nav bar, action menu, login form, search bar, and a pop-up window. BOOM web-app!</p>\n<p>Not so fast.</p>\n<p><em>(From this point forward, I’m assuming you’ve refactored using React.)</em></p>\n<p>What if 14 months from now your users demand more features? Obviously your super successful app has grown to 5,000 (beta) users by now.</p>\n<p>Just find every place you used the card template and add another&lt;div&gt; where needed right? <em>Oh shoot, how does Semantic handle circular images again? That’s all the rave for profile pics right now.</em> Look up HTML template; copy, paste, update content. Panic. <em>This doesn’t look like the sample. Oh right, its ‘</em><strong><em>className’</em></strong><em> not ‘</em><strong><em>class’ —</em></strong>Rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>What if I told you that you never had to copy and paste an HTML template again? Well, if I did I’d be lying because I can’t guarantee that. But what I can do is show you a better way to use these <strong><em>components</em></strong> in your application.</p>\n<p>Most of the popular CSS frameworks also have React Component Libraries. What that means is that they’ve done the repeat work for you. These frameworks provide a a collection of <em>React.Components</em> that you can import into your React application — and thus reuse — throughout your application by simply calling the &lt;Component /&gt; name within your JSX.</p>\n<p>Let’s go back to that Semantic card example from earlier. Remember that 20 line HTML template? With the React component we can write that in 7 lines.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"React shorthand props for creating the card component.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q7DFstq4criAjm3qPUxybg.png\"><figcaption>Fine. It’s <strong>8 lines</strong> with the import.</figcaption></figure><p>What’s happening here? Well, on line 2 we’re rendering a &lt;Card&gt; component with the <em>props</em> of image, header, meta, description, and extra. Those just so happen to be the exact same properties that we set using a set of &lt;div&gt;’s when using the HTML templates.</p>\n<p>Coincidence? 🤔</p>\n<p>So where does the component come from? It’s clear from line one that we import Card from ‘semantic-ui-react’ — which is this particular framework’s package of React Components. Before you are allowed to import components from a framework, you have to physically install the node package using npm/yarn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage\"><strong>Semantic</strong></a><strong>:</strong> yarn add semantic-ui-react<br><a href=\"https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/\"><strong>Bootstrap</strong></a><strong>:</strong> npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap<br><a href=\"https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/\"><strong>Material</strong></a><strong>:</strong> npm install <a href=\"http://twitter.com/material\">@material</a>-ui/core or yarn add <a href=\"http://twitter.com/material\">@material</a>-ui/core</p>\n<p><em>**The three frameworks listed above also require the installation of CSS styling through </em><em>npm/yarn and/or </em><em>cdn delivery. For instructions on installing other frameworks, search for </em><em>[framework] react npm install and follow those instructions.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-ui-component-libraries-frameworks/\">Top 20 React UI Component Libraries for 2020</a></p>\n<p>Once you have installed and imported all the necessary dependencies for the framework of your choice, you’re ready to start building out v2.0 of your app leveraging the power of a React framework.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html\">Thinking In React</a> <em>(if you haven’t read this from the official react.js docs please do so now)</em> we break our UI into a hierarchy of components so that each individual piece of our app is easier to manage. When we imported a framework, what we imported was a set of these components along—with their required styles (the most desirable part of a framework, IMO).</p>\n<h4>Is one framework best?</h4>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>Importing a ui framework allows us to design our app’s component hierarchy with the components we want to use, such as &lt;Card&gt;, in mind. When we plan for a card, we can plan for having a &lt;Card.Group items={2} /&gt; in one view with profile data for some co-founders, and a &lt;Card.Group items={6} /&gt; in another view with a grid layout for recent supporters. Both views contain <strong><em>identical</em></strong> cards, yet they look totally different and contain different data.</p>\n<p>My advice? If you’ve chosen to use a framework with React.js and are looking for documentation, be sure to include the keyword 'react' in your search query.

      "content": "\n<p>If you’ve ever had any exposure to web design, or software engineering you’ve probably been exposed to some sort of framework. Regardless of whether you were working with <a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">Material</a>, <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"https://semantic-ui.com/\">Semantic UI</a>, or <a href=\"https://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a>— they all work largely the same way. The basic concept behind most major frameworks (particularly CSS frameworks) is:</p>\n<blockquote>if you use a predefined element structure in your HTML, and those elements have specific predefined CSS classes, then your web page will display in a fancy way.</blockquote>\n<p>In its most basic form, a CSS framework is essentially a collection of CSS stylesheets that are tailored for use in common situations, like setting up menu bars, buttons, and forms.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A sample of a Semantic UI card component.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/628/1*dpQI218WBE3JneITSdwUfw.png\"><figcaption>Hi Kristy 👋</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How do you use a framework?</strong></p>\n<p>When the time came to implement a framework in your web app, you likely started out by looking through the documentation for one of the more popular frameworks like Bootstrap or Semantic for some styled elements that you wanted to reuse. Once you found one you liked, you clicked a button that said <em>“Try Me” </em>or <em>“View Code”</em> and were then presented with a HTML template.</p>\n<p>For example, Semantic has something called a 'card' which you’ve probably seen all over the internet (looks kind of like Facebook, eh?).</p>\n<p>The HTML code for a card is as follows:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HTML syntax for creating a Card component.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/902/1*yJAG_Jv79UVwYWpa5t4tkA.png\"></figure><p>Wow, that’s a lot of code for a glorified image with a caption.</p>\n<p>Ok, well, if I want to use this element then I guess I have no choice but to copy this code verbatim and change the content to match my needs. I then need to make sure that I import the supporting CSS styles from a CDN (and no, that’s not code from Canada) so that all these class names can get adequately styled.</p>\n<pre>&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.4.2/dist/semantic.min.css\"&gt;</pre>\n<p>Alright so now that you’ve copied the HTML template and imported the stylesheet your card looks great! Now it’s time to style the rest of the cards within your app. Go ahead and copy &amp; paste the HTML template again, now update all the content. I’ll wait…</p>\n<p>Wow, those look fantastic! Oh, you wanted them to display in a nice grid layout? Well why didn’t you say so—that’s a <strong><em>different</em></strong> HTML template. Better go back and rework those other cards now.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you’ve decided by now to use some OO Javascript principles (or even better, React) to help manage this process. If not, you should rethink your app design immediately; <em>that’s a </em><strong><em>huge</em></strong><em> </em><em>.html file dude.</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/64136941fdd9dcbe1d89186bdb75b42b/href\">https://medium.com/media/64136941fdd9dcbe1d89186bdb75b42b/href</a><p>Great, now that you’ve refactored your app to have some sense of hierarchy it’s time to start building out the rest of our app using more HTML templates with even more classes. We just need a nav bar, action menu, login form, search bar, and a pop-up window. BOOM web-app!</p>\n<p>Not so fast.</p>\n<p><em>(From this point forward, I’m assuming you’ve refactored using React.)</em></p>\n<p>What if 14 months from now your users demand more features? Obviously your super successful app has grown to 5,000 (beta) users by now.</p>\n<p>Just find every place you used the card template and add another&lt;div&gt; where needed right? <em>Oh shoot, how does Semantic handle circular images again? That’s all the rave for profile pics right now.</em> Look up HTML template; copy, paste, update content. Panic. <em>This doesn’t look like the sample. Oh right, its ‘</em><strong><em>className’</em></strong><em> not ‘</em><strong><em>class’ —</em></strong>Rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>What if I told you that you never had to copy and paste an HTML template again? Well, if I did I’d be lying because I can’t guarantee that. But what I can do is show you a better way to use these <strong><em>components</em></strong> in your application.</p>\n<p>Most of the popular CSS frameworks also have React Component Libraries. What that means is that they’ve done the repeat work for you. These frameworks provide a a collection of <em>React.Components</em> that you can import into your React application — and thus reuse — throughout your application by simply calling the &lt;Component /&gt; name within your JSX.</p>\n<p>Let’s go back to that Semantic card example from earlier. Remember that 20 line HTML template? With the React component we can write that in 7 lines.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"React shorthand props for creating the card component.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q7DFstq4criAjm3qPUxybg.png\"><figcaption>Fine. It’s <strong>8 lines</strong> with the import.</figcaption></figure><p>What’s happening here? Well, on line 2 we’re rendering a &lt;Card&gt; component with the <em>props</em> of image, header, meta, description, and extra. Those just so happen to be the exact same properties that we set using a set of &lt;div&gt;’s when using the HTML templates.</p>\n<p>Coincidence? 🤔</p>\n<p>So where does the component come from? It’s clear from line one that we import Card from ‘semantic-ui-react’ — which is this particular framework’s package of React Components. Before you are allowed to import components from a framework, you have to physically install the node package using npm/yarn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage\"><strong>Semantic</strong></a><strong>:</strong> yarn add semantic-ui-react<br><a href=\"https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/\"><strong>Bootstrap</strong></a><strong>:</strong> npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap<br><a href=\"https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/\"><strong>Material</strong></a><strong>:</strong> npm install <a href=\"http://twitter.com/material\">@material</a>-ui/core or yarn add <a href=\"http://twitter.com/material\">@material</a>-ui/core</p>\n<p><em>**The three frameworks listed above also require the installation of CSS styling through </em><em>npm/yarn and/or </em><em>cdn delivery. For instructions on installing other frameworks, search for </em><em>[framework] react npm install and follow those instructions.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-ui-component-libraries-frameworks/\">Top 20 React UI Component Libraries for 2020</a></p>\n<p>Once you have installed and imported all the necessary dependencies for the framework of your choice, you’re ready to start building out v2.0 of your app leveraging the power of a React framework.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html\">Thinking In React</a> <em>(if you haven’t read this from the official react.js docs please do so now)</em> we break our UI into a hierarchy of components so that each individual piece of our app is easier to manage. When we imported a framework, what we imported was a set of these components along—with their required styles (the most desirable part of a framework, IMO).</p>\n<h4>Is one framework best?</h4>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>Importing a ui framework allows us to design our app’s component hierarchy with the components we want to use, such as &lt;Card&gt;, in mind. When we plan for a card, we can plan for having a &lt;Card.Group items={2} /&gt; in one view with profile data for some co-founders, and a &lt;Card.Group items={6} /&gt; in another view with a grid layout for recent supporters. Both views contain <strong><em>identical</em></strong> cards, yet they look totally different and contain different data.</p>\n<p>My advice? If you’ve chosen to use a framework with React.js and are looking for documentation, be sure to include the keyword 'react' in your search query. I specifically chose to use Semantic as an example in this post because if (like me) you were to search for 'semantic framework' the most prominent results will be for semantic-ui.com which (strangely) only contains the HTML templates and their corresponding instructions.</p>\n<p>Including the keyword react will land you at something react specific, in this case react.semantic-ui.com.

While all computers <strong>do</strong> use DateTime, not all programming languages process DateTime the same way. This creates some problems for programmers.</p>\n<h3>Ruby &amp; Rails</h3>\n<p>Rails is a common backend framework. Ruby has one main Date class, which contains a subclass of DateTime.

And if LEFT is the same as FULL, then why have two different options to do the same thing? What does FULL mean anyways? I’m so confused…</p>\n<p>Each time I saw this graphic I thought to myself <em>“there </em><strong><em>has</em></strong><em> to be better explanation of this on the internet.”</em> But after years of searching, I’ve turned up nothing but variations of this lunar calendar graphic. So, I took the matter into my own hands and decided to write out each JOIN using a language I have a good grasp on; <strong>Ruby.</strong></p>\n<p>So, without further ado, here are <strong>SQL Joins as Ruby Methods</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> While the Ruby syntax below looks correct, </em><strong><em>this is pseudocode</em></strong><em> meant to represent SQL actions. I do not recommend that you copy and paste anything into your application (isn’t that plagiarism?).</em></p>\n<h3>INNER JOIN</h3>\n<p>I decided to start with the one that <em>did</em> make sense to me, the only one that actually <em>does</em> work like a venn diagram (but who asked me). An INNER JOIN will <em>iterate</em> through each row in the first table, and select that row when there is a match in the second table. When selecting that row, the data from the second table is also included in the new dataset.</p>\n<p>Here it is in <strong>Ruby.</strong></p>\n<pre>def INNER_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>   new_table = {} ## create a new empty table<br>   # for each row in table_1<br>   table_1.select do |table_1_row| <br>     # scan table_2 and find the data that matches <br>      table_2_match = table_2.find do |table_2_row| <br>          table_2_row.column == table_1_row.column<br>      end<br>      # if a match is found (if result is true)<br>      # add specified column(s) to new_table as a key/value pair<br>      if table_2_match<br>         new_table[:table_1_data] = table_1_row.column<br>         new_table[:table_2_data] = table_2_row_match.column<br>      end<br>      return new_table<br>      # if no data matched, new_table will be empty<br>   end<br>end</pre>\n<p>Let’s refer to this as a .select/.select relationship.</p>\n<p><strong><em>I know</em></strong><em>, </em>we used .find on table_2.<em> </em>But, we are still in theory <strong>selecting</strong> data subsets from both tables—again, it’s pseudocode.</p>\n<h3>LEFT JOIN</h3>\n<p>What a LEFT JOIN does is <em>iterate</em> through each row in the first table, and checks the second table for a corresponding value. If the second table contains a match, the data from the second table is appended to that row in the first table. <strong>All rows from the first table are returned.</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll refer this as a .map/.find relationship. We are <em>mapping</em> the first set of data to a new dataset. While doing so, we are iterating over the second data set to find a match to be included in our new data set.</p>\n<pre>def LEFT_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>   new_table = {}<br>   # for each row in table_1<br>   table_1.map do |table_1_row|<br>     # scan table_2 and find the data that matches<br>     table_2_match = table_2.find do |table_2_row| <br>         table_2_row.column == table_1_row.column<br>     end<br>     # add the row of table_1 regardless of the match<br>     new_table[:table_1_data] = table_1_row<br>     # if a match is found (if result is true)<br>     # add specified column(s) to new_table as a key/value pair<br>     if table_2_match<br>           new_table[:table_2_data] = table_2_match.column<br>     end<br>     return new_table<br>     # if no data matched, all rows from table_1 will be included<br>  end<br>end</pre>\n<p>Why is this called a <em>LEFT</em> join? Well, in English we read from left to right. Look at the arguments for this method, which table appears on the left?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qalb_(programming_language)\">Do they code from right to left in Arabic?</a> 🤔</p>\n<h3>RIGHT JOIN</h3>\n<p>We already know from that handy documentation above that a RIGHT JOIN is the opposite of a LEFT JOIN. Knowing that, we can assume that a RIGHT JOIN works the same way, except it <em>iterates</em> through table_2 <strong>first</strong> (using .map) and then <em>iterates</em> through table_1 using .find.</p>\n<pre>def RIGHT_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>   new_table = {}<br>   # for each row in table_2<br>   table_2.map do |table_2_row|<br>       # scan table_1 and find the data that matches<br>       table_1_match = table_1.find do |table_1_row| <br>           table_1_row.column == table_2_row.column<br>       end<br>       # add the row of table_2 regardless of the match<br>       new_table[:table_2_data] = table_2_row<br>       # if a match is found (if result is true)<br>       # add specified column(s) to new_table as a key/value pair<br>       if table_1_match<br>          new_table[:table_1_data] = table_1_match.column<br>       end<br>      return new_table<br>      # if no data matched, all rows from table_2 will be included<br>   end<br>end</pre>\n<p>Why is this called a <em>RIGHT</em> join? Again, we read from left to right. Look at the arguments for this method, which table appears on the <em>right</em>? You’ll also notice that we switched the order in which we iterate through the tables, but not the order in which we call the arguments themselves.</p>\n<h3>OUTER JOIN</h3>\n<p>I actually had a really hard time writing this one in Ruby. I think that’s because I couldn’t think of a practical example in which I’d need an OUTER JOIN so it was difficult for me to walk through the process logically. So, I’m going to just skip it for now. I’ll figure it out when the time comes.</p>\n<pre>def OUTER_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>    puts \"Coming Soon\"<br>end</pre>\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\n<p>This was fun. But even after doing this exercise, SQL joins continue to be a pain in the @$$ <em>(oh stop, it’s an instance variable)</em>. But, hopefully they make a little more sense to you now. If not, there’s always <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord/\"><strong>Active Record</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Actually, even if you <em>do</em> understand SQL joins, just use <strong>Active Record</strong>. It’ll change your life as a Rubyist. But more on that later. 🙃</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/350c7f7e4946eaf1f83c6f623b74b2f9/href\">https://medium.com/media/350c7f7e4946eaf1f83c6f623b74b2f9/href</a><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=be9475f2b569\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

In fact, I hated joins so much that my go to move was to download the data to <em>.csv</em> and perform a bunch of VLOOKUP functions in Excel™</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/ecaea266ce4553f206dc4b9beeca36ed/href\">https://medium.com/media/ecaea266ce4553f206dc4b9beeca36ed/href</a><p>I know. <strong>I apologize.</strong></p>\n<p>The reason I was scared of JOINs is because whenever I looked up examples and documentation I always found something that looked like this:</p>\n<pre>SELECT * FROM employees e<br> JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id<br> LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id<br> INNER JOIN departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id<br> OUTER JOIN employees dm ON d.manager_id = dm.employee_id<br> LEFT JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id<br> LEFT JOIN countries c ON l.country_id = c.country_id<br> RIGHT JOIN regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id<br> LEFT OUTER JOIN jobs jj ON jj.job_id = jh.job_id<br>ORDER BY e.employee_id;</pre>\n<p>I’d then inevitably come across some super useful documentation paired with the lunar calendar of venn diagrams <em>(if you’re thinking that’s not how venn diagrams work, you’re right)</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>(INNER) JOIN:</strong> Returns records that have matching values in both tables<br><strong>LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:</strong> Returns all records from the left table, with matches from the right<br><strong>RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:</strong> Returns all records from the right table, with matches from the left<br><strong>FULL (OUTER) JOIN:</strong> Returns all records when there is a match<br><br><strong>TIPS:</strong> <strong>FULL OUTER JOIN</strong>, <strong>FULL JOIN</strong> and <strong>LEFT JOIN</strong> are all the same.<br><strong>RIGHT JOIN</strong> is the opposite of <strong>LEFT JOIN</strong>.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rA5b_M2rYZzDmj5JUzhYvg.jpeg\"><figcaption>SQLunar Calendar??</figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/06346dbd97ad9cc6b475f0e96052f848/href\">https://medium.com/media/06346dbd97ad9cc6b475f0e96052f848/href</a><p><strong>Hold Up.</strong> If FULL OUTER returns matches in both the LEFT and RIGHT, then why use LEFT and RIGHT at all? And if LEFT is the same as FULL, then why have two different options to do the same thing? What does FULL mean anyways? I’m so confused…</p>\n<p>Each time I saw this graphic I thought to myself <em>“there </em><strong><em>has</em></strong><em> to be better explanation of this on the internet.”</em> But after years of searching, I’ve turned up nothing but variations of this lunar calendar graphic. So, I took the matter into my own hands and decided to write out each JOIN using a language I have a good grasp on; <strong>Ruby.</strong></p>\n<p>So, without further ado, here are <strong>SQL Joins as Ruby Methods</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> While the Ruby syntax below looks correct, </em><strong><em>this is pseudocode</em></strong><em> meant to represent SQL actions. I do not recommend that you copy and paste anything into your application (isn’t that plagiarism?).</em></p>\n<h3>INNER JOIN</h3>\n<p>I decided to start with the one that <em>did</em> make sense to me, the only one that actually <em>does</em> work like a venn diagram (but who asked me). An INNER JOIN will <em>iterate</em> through each row in the first table, and select that row when there is a match in the second table. When selecting that row, the data from the second table is also included in the new dataset.</p>\n<p>Here it is in <strong>Ruby.</strong></p>\n<pre>def INNER_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>   new_table = {} ## create a new empty table<br>   # for each row in table_1<br>   table_1.select do |table_1_row| <br>     # scan table_2 and find the data that matches <br>      table_2_match = table_2.find do |table_2_row| <br>          table_2_row.column == table_1_row.column<br>      end<br>      # if a match is found (if result is true)<br>      # add specified column(s) to new_table as a key/value pair<br>      if table_2_match<br>         new_table[:table_1_data] = table_1_row.column<br>         new_table[:table_2_data] = table_2_row_match.column<br>      end<br>      return new_table<br>      # if no data matched, new_table will be empty<br>   end<br>end</pre>\n<p>Let’s refer to this as a .select/.select relationship.</p>\n<p><strong><em>I know</em></strong><em>, </em>we used .find on table_2.<em> </em>But, we are still in theory <strong>selecting</strong> data subsets from both tables—again, it’s pseudocode.</p>\n<h3>LEFT JOIN</h3>\n<p>What a LEFT JOIN does is <em>iterate</em> through each row in the first table, and checks the second table for a corresponding value. If the second table contains a match, the data from the second table is appended to that row in the first table. <strong>All rows from the first table are returned.</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll refer this as a .map/.find relationship. We are <em>mapping</em> the first set of data to a new dataset. While doing so, we are iterating over the second data set to find a match to be included in our new data set.</p>\n<pre>def LEFT_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>   new_table = {}<br>   # for each row in table_1<br>   table_1.map do |table_1_row|<br>     # scan table_2 and find the data that matches<br>     table_2_match = table_2.find do |table_2_row| <br>         table_2_row.column == table_1_row.column<br>     end<br>     # add the row of table_1 regardless of the match<br>     new_table[:table_1_data] = table_1_row<br>     # if a match is found (if result is true)<br>     # add specified column(s) to new_table as a key/value pair<br>     if table_2_match<br>           new_table[:table_2_data] = table_2_match.column<br>     end<br>     return new_table<br>     # if no data matched, all rows from table_1 will be included<br>  end<br>end</pre>\n<p>Why is this called a <em>LEFT</em> join? Well, in English we read from left to right. Look at the arguments for this method, which table appears on the left?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qalb_(programming_language)\">Do they code from right to left in Arabic?</a> 🤔</p>\n<h3>RIGHT JOIN</h3>\n<p>We already know from that handy documentation above that a RIGHT JOIN is the opposite of a LEFT JOIN. Knowing that, we can assume that a RIGHT JOIN works the same way, except it <em>iterates</em> through table_2 <strong>first</strong> (using .map) and then <em>iterates</em> through table_1 using .find.</p>\n<pre>def RIGHT_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>   new_table = {}<br>   # for each row in table_2<br>   table_2.map do |table_2_row|<br>       # scan table_1 and find the data that matches<br>       table_1_match = table_1.find do |table_1_row| <br>           table_1_row.column == table_2_row.column<br>       end<br>       # add the row of table_2 regardless of the match<br>       new_table[:table_2_data] = table_2_row<br>       # if a match is found (if result is true)<br>       # add specified column(s) to new_table as a key/value pair<br>       if table_1_match<br>          new_table[:table_1_data] = table_1_match.column<br>       end<br>      return new_table<br>      # if no data matched, all rows from table_2 will be included<br>   end<br>end</pre>\n<p>Why is this called a <em>RIGHT</em> join? Again, we read from left to right. Look at the arguments for this method, which table appears on the <em>right</em>? You’ll also notice that we switched the order in which we iterate through the tables, but not the order in which we call the arguments themselves.</p>\n<h3>OUTER JOIN</h3>\n<p>I actually had a really hard time writing this one in Ruby. I think that’s because I couldn’t think of a practical example in which I’d need an OUTER JOIN so it was difficult for me to walk through the process logically. So, I’m going to just skip it for now. I’ll figure it out when the time comes.</p>\n<pre>def OUTER_JOIN(table_1, table_2)<br>    puts \"Coming Soon\"<br>end</pre>\n<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\n<p>This was fun. But even after doing this exercise, SQL joins continue to be a pain in the @$$ <em>(oh stop, it’s an instance variable)</em>. But, hopefully they make a little more sense to you now. If not, there’s always <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord/\"><strong>Active Record</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Actually, even if you <em>do</em> understand SQL joins, just use <strong>Active Record</strong>. It’ll change your life as a Rubyist. But more on that later. 🙃</p>\n<p>cakehole out.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/350c7f7e4946eaf1f83c6f623b74b2f9/href\">https://medium.com/media/350c7f7e4946eaf1f83c6f623b74b2f9/href</a><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=be9475f2b569\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",
