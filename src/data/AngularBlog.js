In fact, React is so much my go-to framework that a friend of mine jokingly called me out on it, asking if I could even name another framework.</p>
<p><strong>I could.</strong></p>
<p>I got the hint though. Acknowledging to myself that I hadn't used any other frameworks very much, if at all...</p>
<p>So, I decided it was time to try Angular. Here's how it went.</p>

<h3>Angular in a Nutshell</h3>
<p>Before I dive into my analysis, let's just touch on what Angular is and how it differs from React. For starters, Angular is an open-sourced TypeScript-based framework (whereas React is a Javascript library). Angular is maintained by Google, along with the open source community (React is maintained by Facebook). Another very important thing to note is that Angular and AngularJS are different things. AngularJS (or Angular v1) is a Javascript library just like React. Angular2+ is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, re-designed as a full fledged framework.</p>
<h4>Framework vs Library</h4>
<p>So what does it mean that Angular is a <em>Framework</em>, but React is a <em>Library</em>? Well, when using a library, you have more control over the flow of the application. <strong>You</strong> are choosing when and where to call the library's components and functions. When you use a framework, <strong>the framework</strong> is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but only calls on your code as needed.</p>
<p>Here's a great analogy I recently came across: <strong>Libraries are like shopping at Ikea.</strong> The home is already built; but you get to pick out the furniture for each room and arrange it how you want. <strong>Frameworkes are more like buying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears_Modern_Homes">Sears Home Kit</a>;</strong> the materials only fit together as defined in the blueprint and there's not much room for creative input.</p>
